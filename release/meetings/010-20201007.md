## Notes
* Review the updated release process doc (PR https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/2866)
  * The release verification process is not clear. Jackie provided the updates:
    * The functional verification will be done by running node and shape inference tests in ONNX runtime, using ONNX repo release branch.
    * The package verification will be done by running ONNX unit tests and model tests with model zoo models, using release candidates from TestPypi.
* A couple of release automation projects need some updates (issue https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2904)
  * onnx feedstock enables Windows conda package: completed and verified
  * wheel build updated for release 1.8: to be worked on to build release packages and push them to TestPypi and Pypi
* Release 1.8 (issue https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2942)
  * Release features/highlights: created a 1.8 milestone, deadline 10/9 
  * Should we provide release 1.8 update in 10/14 workshop? There was a short update for 1.7 as part of the TSC session in last workshop. Jackie to reach out to TSC or workshop host for a time slot.
  * We should plan and announce the date to create release branch so that developers know the deadline to complete and merger their PRs.
