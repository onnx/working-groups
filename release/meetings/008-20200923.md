  * onnx feedstock enable Windows conda package: partner companies to comment on whether working or not using Windows Conda environment
  * wheel builder update for new env setup for 1.8: will be worked to use Azure pipelines
* Release 1.8 (issue https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/2942)
  * Release features/highlights: create a 1.8 milestone in github with the release date so developers can tag PRs for the release
  * Python 2.7 is no longer supported, some work has been done to remove from CI, will need to update the release 1.8 build process
  * Any roadmap discussions would affect release 1.8 scope? No specific items from roadmap discussions. Will leave it to indivisual item owners to decide if fit into the release timeframe

## Action items
* Create 1.8 milestone and announce in slack
