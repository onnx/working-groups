## Agenda
* Discussions
    * Release verification
    * Automation projects
    * Release 1.8

## Attendees
* Chin Huang (IBM)
* Jacky Chun-Wei Chen (Microsoft)
* Anna June (VMWare)

## Notes
* Review the updated release process doc
  * The release verification process is documented in a new PR (https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/3102)
  * Recommend to make the verification script between ONNX and ONNX Runtime available in ONNX repo so next release team can easily access it
  * Recommend to open an issue to track the verification of converters so it is transparent
* A couple of release automation projects need some updates
  * wheel builder is updated for release 1.8
* Release 1.8
  * Available in Pypi and conda on 11/04/2020
  * Should we conclude and close the release working group since 1.8 is out and the release instructions documented?
  * Consider adding to-dos to the ONNX release doc
  * Connect with LF AI to make the release annoucement there
  * Recommend ONNX-Tensorflow to handle non numeric version numbers such as 1.8.0rc since the packages in TestPypi will have 'rc' in their version number
  * Consider to have a postmorten meeting to share findings and discuss what can be done better for release 1.9
