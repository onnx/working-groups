## Meeting notes:

### Status

* [MERGED] Affine grid generator operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5225
* [MERGED] Image decoder operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5294
* [MERGED] StringSplit operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5371
* [MERGED] StringConcat Operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5350
* [MERGED] Add RegexFullMatch operator - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/pull/5401

### ImageDecoder in ResNet - ONNX / ORT release plans

* ONNX 1.15 release - Tentative October 10
* ONNX Runtime supporting opset 20:

    - 2 months after the ONNX release
    - Code freeze ~November
    - Release ~December

* Draft PR:

    - https://github.com/onnx/models/pull/627
    - Will wait until ONNX runtime has support for image decoder

* Implementation

    - Planned for next release. Will probably use OpenCV or and/other libraries (TurboJPEG)

### Next steps

* Enable preprocessing models for other domains

    - NLP (BERT?) - tokenizer, etc
    - Medical (UNet-3D?) - Liqun Fu will present about its requirements on next meeting
    - Audio

* Moving work from onnxruntime-extensions into the standard

    - Need to be addressed on operator by operator basis

### Open floor

* The goal of this group is to fill the gap on ONNX models, so that the preprocessing part is not done separately.
* Proposing operators can be handled by the Operators SIG
