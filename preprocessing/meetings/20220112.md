## Meeting notes:

* SequenceMap function PR is under review. Seems to work as expected.
* Initial experiments show that using model metadata properties to tag a function as the preprocessing part of the graph will be enough for any backends to detect special parts of the graph (preprocessing, postprocessing).
* Several issues were found regarding using model local functions (ONNX and ONNX runtime):
    - https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/10249
    - https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/10250
    - https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/3938
* We will continue with these two lines of work and once those are completed we will be able to create a first prototype (RN50) and publish it
