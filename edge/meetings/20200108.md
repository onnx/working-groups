### Notes

  * Edge WG letter was discussed by the steering committee on 12/19.
  * SC agreed that it makes sense to end the Edge WG for now. WGs are meant to be short term with a specific scope. Its completely okay if the conclusion is that the scope is not right or not of enough interest. We can always spin up another WG with the same or different scope when the time is right.
