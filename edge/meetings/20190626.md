* **Milan**: Pointed to Operators SIG meetings. First meeting was 2 weeks ago. Another one today.
  See [Operators SIG gitter](https://gitter.im/onnx/operators). There is agenda item (organize operators by domain) which may have overlap with edge profile definition.
  Milan plans to attend today's meeting to bring it up. Saurabh will follow up with participants from Intel in that regard as well.
* **Milan**: ONNX SIGs steering committee published [SIGs Best Practices](https://github.com/onnx/sigs/blob/master/best-practices.md) and asked if the same set of rules should be applied to WGs.  Milan replied that it is fine, since that is already what Edge WG is doing.
* Next meeting
  * Review a few "prototype" profiles (main purpose is to test profile definition through attributes)
  * Review and establish profile definition template.


### Action Items
* **Milan**: Publish meeting minutes and recording.
