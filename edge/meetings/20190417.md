  * **Yedong**: Created new PR [ONNX Edge Scenario Discussion](https://github.com/onnx/working-groups/pull/3), update to Howard's PR. 
  * **Ofer**: Documents submitted by Yedong and Howard (Huawei) are great starting points for definiton of edge profiles. Once we define SoW.
  * **Ofer**: suggested creating "discussion materials" folder where docs like the one from Howard / Yedong could be placed into. There was no objection to this suggestion.
  * **Saurabh**: About MLPerf, are they comitted to ONNX as input format? Consider other benchmarking partners if MLPerf does not work out.
    * E.g. [TPC](http://www.tpc.org/), [AIBench](http://www.aibench.org/)
  * **Milan**: Bechmarking is related to compliance. We need to initiate contact with other ONNX groups as a heads up for cooperation.
  * **Ofer**: We could encourage benchmarking orgs to participate in ONNX WG if they want to influence or contribute with purpose of alignment with their work.
