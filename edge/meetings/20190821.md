* Discussed proposal for profile topology map
  * https://github.com/onnx/working-groups/blob/master/edge/discussion_materials/onnx-profile-topology-map.md
  * Ofer - good approach, profile definiton can be tied to data sensor/input type, so today it is 2d image and audio, but new profiles can be added in future for other input types
  * Saurabh suggested that data locality does not have to be binary attribute, could be connected to bandwidth requirment
  * In general proposal is worth pursuing further, we should bring it up in workshop for discussion.
