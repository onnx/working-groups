* **Milan**: Short update on acceptance status of "Edge scope and profile definition" document. As per replies in https://github.com/onnx/working-groups/issues/7 document is accepted. Did not receive reply from Saurabh yet, but majority of contributors approved it.
Next step is to copy document to artifacts folder.

  * Work with Milan to combine that with proposal for profile definiton template.
