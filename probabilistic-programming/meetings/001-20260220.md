Next steps: 

* Adam: Merge the RNG write-up (GitHub gist) and related documents (slides, design doc) into the working group repository, and tidy up/iterate on the document.
* Adam: Review the ONNX operator proposal template shared by Andreas and prepare the RNG operator proposal (including new operator and corrections to existing ones) in the required format, and create a Python reference implementation.
* Brian: Convert the existing PowerPoint slides outlining the roadmap/timeline into a Markdown document for the working group repository.
* Brian: Handle outreach for the working group, including posting about the new working group on LinkedIn, Twitter, Discord, and relevant meetups, and continue weekly outreach to potential new members.
* Dmitry: Share information about the new working group with the PiData Eindhoven/Amsterdam meetups and personal network.
* Andreas: Share the ONNX presentation slides with Dmitry (and others if needed) for further review.
* Andreas: Share the ONNX operator proposal template/link in the Slack channel for Adam.
* All: Schedule and attend bi-weekly working group meetings (Andreas to confirm access and manage calendar invites).
* Brian and Adam: After the Markdown roadmap document is ready, prepare and post a LinkedIn/Twitter announcement about the new working group, referencing the Markdown document.
* Adam: Post relevant links (operator proposal template, etc.) in the Slack channel for group reference.


## New ONNX Working Group Launch:

* The meeting focused on establishing a new working group within ONNX, with discussions about logistics, GitHub repository management, and content sharing.
* Andreas explained issues with the LFX tool and suggested announcing the new working group on LinkedIn or Twitter, while Adam and Brian discussed merging documents and slide decks into the GitHub repository.
* * The group also addressed random number generation improvements and probabilistic programming, with Adam sharing his expertise in Java ML libraries and deterministic ML systems.



## Bayesian Systems Collaboration Discussion:

* Brian and Dmitry introduced themselves and discussed their backgrounds in probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference.
* Brian shared his experience with open source work on Julia Stan and his interest in reproducible machine learning and Bayesian systems for BCI applications.
* Dmitry described his work on Erikson-Fer, a Julia-based toolbox for probabilistic programming, focusing on efficient Bayesian inference for embedded systems.
* Both expressed interest in the Onyx working group and its potential applications to their respective projects, particularly in scaling and deploying Bayesian-based systems.



## Outreach Planning:

* Brian outlined next steps, including spec writing and helping Adam with RNG implementation refactoring. 
* They plan to continue outreach efforts, with Brian mentioning connections in Dubai working on a Python version of Inla and potential collaboration on a Pyro exporter. 
* Brian also manages several meetups in New York, reaching around 10,000-12,000 people, and plans to announce their working group through these channels and on Discord.
* The group discussed organizing meetings and outreach efforts in the Eindhoven area, with Dmitry mentioning their PiDate events and potential connections with tech companies like Philips and Dell.
* Adam explained the limitations of ONNX computation graph, noting that it cannot handle unbounded recursion, which affects its ability to perform certain operations like sampling from probability distributions.
* The team plans to address this by identifying and implementing necessary primitive operations, starting with random number generation behavior, to expand the language's capabilities.

## ONNX: Model Exchange Standard:

* The group discussed ONNX, a standardized format for representing computational graphs that can be used to exchange models between different machine learning frameworks.
* Adam explained that ONNX has a runtime developed by Microsoft that can execute models in the ONNX format, while exporters and converters allow models to be imported from and exported to other frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
* Brian highlighted the increasing adoption of Bayesian methods in fields like marketing, noting the need for scalable solutions to deploy these models at scale.
* The discussion also touched on the development of ONNX operators, which grew out of a collaboration between Microsoft and Facebook to provide a common export format for neural network libraries.

## ONNX Standardization Discussion:

* The team discussed ONNX, a standard for exchanging models between different frameworks. 
* Andreas presented on ONNX's capabilities and challenges, noting its cross-platform nature and versioning system.
* The group explored how ONNX could be used to standardize model execution across different frameworks, though they acknowledged some limitations.
* Brian and Adam shared insights on using ONNX with Julia and other languages, highlighting the need for better quality exporters.
* The conversation ended with plans to further develop the RNG and operator specifications, with Brian offering to share additional materials on probabilistic programming.

## Operator Process and Meeting Updates:

* The group discussed the process for adding operators and making proposals, with Andreas providing guidance on the template and review process.
* Adam mentioned delays due to snow but committed to merging his write-up into the working group and creating a Python reference implementation.
* The team agreed to convert their PowerPoint presentation into a markdown document and share it, with Brian suggesting a two-week cadence for future meetings.
* Andreas confirmed he had updated the meeting schedule and shared it with the group.
