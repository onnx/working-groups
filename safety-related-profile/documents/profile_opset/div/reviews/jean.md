In the text below, the link to C1 does not work.
### $B$: real
Denominator of the division.

#### Constraints

 - `[C1]` Shape consistency
   -  Statement: see constraint [<b><span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace">[C1]</span></b>](#C1ra) on tensor $A$.

It is the case of all this kind of links to previously defined constraint.

Rmq2: Unit verification sections
How these sections will be used? Are there directly usable?
What is their added-value with respect to the mathematical formulae?

Rmq3: Unit verification sections (if kept in the informal spec).

The second Unit verification section should refer to the first one for what concerns the defintion of SymbolicDomainError.

Rmq4: Unit verification sections (if kept in the informal spec).

The following text should be replaced by a reference to the first Unit verification section: "This section contains a verification scenario to verify the above specification for any C/C++ implementation. It uses an abstract type SymbolicDomainError replacing each real number in the Why3 specification. SymbolicDomainError is a data structure with 4 fields:"

Rmq5: Traceability tags should be defined.
