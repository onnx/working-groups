- In ONNX, the operator is `Where`, not `WHERE`. (To be checked for `Conv`.)
- Should we generalize the restriction on the usage of [sparse tensors](https://onnx.ai/onnx/intro/concepts.html#sparse-tensor)?  
- Put R2 as the first restriction so that R1 and R3 are in sequence. 
- Restrictions about sparse tensors and broadcasting, no shape / type inference should probably put in a unique / common document.
- "- `Z`: output tensor based on the `condition`, `X`, and `Y`" => "- `Z`: output tensor"
- "if the corresponding entry" => make "corresponding" more explicit? (to be discussed since there is a mathematical expression just after...)
- "is different of false" => "is True" (to be homogeneous with the previous statements)
- figure
  - if the figure has been copied, please indicate the source.
  - "Cond" => "condition"
  - show the condition tensor on the figure
- examples
  - give an example not using Booleans but numerical values
- python
  - **To be discussed: should we generalize this (e.g., provide a jupyter notebook with examples)** This could be a good idea...
- Description of condition`
  - constraints
    - "consistency in shape" => "shape consistency"?
    - "N" must be defined and check if it is necessary.
- Description of `X
    - Add the type
    - "[...] based on the [...]" => "[...] based on [...]"
    - constraint : use a cross-ref to the previous constraint.
- Description of `Y`
  - *same remarks as for `X`*
- Description of `Z`
  - "The tensor `Z` [...]" => "Tensor `Z` [...]"
- Attributes
  - "The where operator does not require any attributes." =?=> "The where operator has no attribute." or "Not applicable".
- Formal specification 
  - To be removed for the moment.
