    * Constraint C4 Rationale: Add a period (.) at the end.

- For input W (tensor of real):
    * Add a period (.) at the end of the descriptions for dW_0 and dW_1 / dW_2.


**ATTRIBUTES**

- Constraint C3 (General):
    * In the statement, the word "bve" should be corrected to "be".
    * Add a period (.) at the end of the statement.

- strides:
    * Constraint C2 Statement: Add a period (.) at the end.
