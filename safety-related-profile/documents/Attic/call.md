Our work on defining ONNX is progressing—albeit slowly—thanks to the dedication of a **small group** of contributors.

Initially, our meetings had around 15 participants, but attendance has gradually declined to a critically low level, with only seven attendees in our last meeting.

**This situation is hardly sustainable if we aim to deliver the first SONNX profile by the end of the year.**

So, we urgently need to expand our team to:

- Continue specifying SONNX operators,
- Finalize the format specification (primarily verification and potential completion),
- Develop the "SONNX checker" tool,
- Alleviate the burden on the core team.

So far, we have refrained from broadening our audience, assuming the initial group was already sufficiently large and that it would be more effective to engage a wider audience once we had a solid set of preliminary results. While we have not fully reached this point, we are getting close and we plan to get talk during ONNX next meetup in June.

The key problem is that most of the people have no dedicated funding for this activity, which obviously strongly limit the commitment… **In this situation, having a clear view of what effort you can spend on SONNX would really help sharing the work. Please tell us.**

If your capability is more of less the time we spend in our meetings, o**ne possibility could be to shorten the meetings and use this time to do actual work on smaller and more focused tasks.**  Would you agree?

Another solution could be to setup some form of collaborative project (funded by the participants and/ secure external funding to allocate dedicated resources for key tasks, thereby lightening the workload of the working group. 

If you have any ideas about this modality, please tell us.

Finally, we also have to address the root causes for this situation:

- A general lack of interest in the topic,
- Diverging views on the objectives,
- Differences in the way the working group is managed.

While there may be little we can do about (i), we can certainly improve (ii) and (iii).

We welcome your feedback—please let us know what you think could or should be improved.

Thank you for your cooperation.
