I think that inputs and outputs shall be defined as elements of the graph.

Edge: "the input" <-- "a specific input", idem for "output" and idem for the "graph". May be the concept of "port" could be used.

The illustration highlights ports and a hierarchical graph structure (one node includes the four nodes).

(C1): Why zero input? I would prefer at least one input.

Add (C8): At least one ouput of each node is connected either to an output of the graph or to an input of another node. Rationale: Each component should have a function. May be redondant with [R1].

"Please note that the sub operator has been removed since it is not used by any other node or as an output of the graph." is contradictory with "%op4_out = Sub(%I1, %I2)".

Behaviour: Add "Initially, all input values of the graph are defined." and "When an ouput of a node is connected to the input of another node by an edge the definition of the
value of the output of the first node implies the definition of the value of the input of the second node".

May be the definition of the graph should be exended to include in its structure the special nodes.
