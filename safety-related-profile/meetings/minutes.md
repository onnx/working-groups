## Attendees
Edoardo, Eric, Jean, Mariem, Sebastian, Augustin, Dumitru, Henri, Nicolas, Cong, Jean-Loup [sorry, some names are probably missing ; I don't know how to obtain the list of attendees using LFAI...]

## Minutes 
- Edoardo's slides can be found [here](./slides/2025-01-15-Edoardo_Manino_SONNX_slides.pdf).
- Status of the current outoputs of our WG. We are a bit late with respect to the initial plan... 
  - Concerning the specification work, we can take `conv` as an example, even though it may be later modified thanks to the lessons learnt on other operators.
  - We have to find people to work on the specification. See action [1501-1] and [1501-2].
- Status of the work on formal methods. 
  - The strategy is not clear yet...
  - Mariem organizes a meeting to find a consensual formalization strategy. See action [1501-3].
- Discussion on Henri's specification of the `where` operator. 
  - It can be reviewed, see action [1501-4].
  - In order to enforce determinism, broadcasting should be forbidden. This is a general rule to be applied to all operators.
  - In a conservative manner, we may express restrictions in the first version of the operator and relax those restrictions later should they represent too strong a constrainst.
  - Discussion about the `if` operator which allows different subgraphs to be executed depending on a boolean value. Note that this operator does not violate the general rule about the execution condition of an operator: by construction, the `if` operator execute either one or another graph that are completely separated (they do not join).  
  - Discussion about `if`concern the specification of the graph execution semantics, which is an activity that has not yet started. 
-  Presentation of some of the issues identified by Anne-Sophie. 
   - Discussion about the interpretation of the tensor axis indexes. How do they relate to batch, channels, etc. Should we express this relation in the specification (ex. `split`operator). It actually depend on the operator: for some operators, this interpretation is necessary, and for other it is not. For instance, the `add` operator works can be used without giving any particular interpretation to the tensor's dimension (all axes play a symmetrical role). this is not the case for the convolution for instance. 
   -  Some issues actually concern the graph execution semantics. See action [1501-5].
   -  Remarks have to be reviewed (action [1501-6])in order to see if there reveal an actual issue and, if yes, how to address it. When there is an ambiguity, we may rely on an actual implementation of the ONNX specification to determine the actual semantics. But which implementation should be taken as a reference? OnnexRuntime, another? One solution may be to ask the ONNX committee in charge of the operators.  (see action [1501-7]).
- Concerning the question about the ARP, the list of question has been reviewed. Eric will send it to the WG114 in the name of the workgroup. See action [1501-8].

## Minutes
(The meeting has been recorded and is available [here](https://zoom.us/rec/play/Gp1BMRCA01sUw-m0lXeewLgfPIPRlluJ3Cfi_AakBAruDRvm5CSWSf_bj19PHA6Ky99dXm2mlASBkEKu.Ws8R97q6D_W-k0a_?canPlayFromShare=true&from=share_recording_detail&continueMode=true&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FPTdcIxVJaVSPh1Ze39mu3zmVqjYJ0sB33oR76VOsWpsKlbnaGtQwa7r4bkp1OF3a.5BpTwCuQlXolU4uC) for those who have an LFX account. Note that there is also a full textual transcript of the meeting, which includes all the Mmmm, the hesitations, the globbish, etc. Nevertheless, this is extremely handy, you can even click on the text and the video will move at the appropriate place. If we were able to cut /paste the transcript in ChatGPT to generate a synthesis, that'll be perfect...)
- Sebastian's presentation on Bosch's Embedded Ai coder.
  - Two things (please refer to the video for the full contents):
    - Bosch is (in particular) targetting very small models (starting with a few hundrerds parameters) to be run on very small targets (microcontrollers).
    - One important expectation for Bosch: having a tool to check the (S)ONNX model... 
    - One important expectation for Bosch's customer: be able to reproduce results on a long time span. 
- Brief overview of the first version of the [requirement list](../documents/reqs.md). There has been quite a few comments on reqs 19 and 20 about errors. This issue will be addressed in a separate discussion (see action 1812-2) 
- Discussion about the list of operators and the way we have to "process them"
  - We have to share the work! Eric will add a "complexoity" evaluation to the current list of operators (1812-4), then every contributor can put his/her name in front of the operator on which he/she can contribute (as a writer, a reviewer). See action (1812-5). Note that we will start the work when the specification of the ``conv`` operator is completed (since it will be used as a template).
- Sebastian raised an important remark concerning the actual capability of people to contribute to the effort. Everyone has to check the legal aspects of contributing to the SONNX effort which, eventually, will be part of ONNX (exact modalities have to be addressed). See action (1812-6)

## Participants
Eric, Mariem, Edoardo, Pierre B., Jean-Loup, Pierre G., Mohammed, Jean-Baptiste, Thiziri, Henri, Jean, Julien, Eric B., Andreas F., Nicolas, Cong, Dittberner Andreas D.,  Sebastian

## Minutes
- CS case study.
  - Mohamed has provided a short description of CS' use case to be integrated in the [list of use cases](../documents/usecases.md). See action (0412-1).
- Review of Airbus' needs.
  - Current content is a raw integration of material provided by Sergei and discussed with Jean and Eric.
  - The needs have first to be checked by the authors in oder to remove redundancy, ensure that the needs are clear (see e.g., need about resource usage). See action (0412-2)
- Review of [Jean-Baptiste's analysis of the ARP6983](../documents/analysis_of_standards/SONNX_requirements_draft1.docx)\
  Several questions were raised during the presentation:
  - The standard requires the MLMD to carry the hyperparameters used during training...
    - What do they call "hyperparameters", exactly? According to some interpretation, the architecture of the model is itself described by "hyperparameters" (in the sense that when using AutoML, the architecture is also "learnt"). This has to be clarified. 
    - Why do they require this? To ensure the repeatability of the training process? But in that case, we need more that this. We need a complete description of the training environment, possibly the exact scheduling of the training operations, etc.  What is the exact intent of this requirement?
      - Pseudo Random Number Generators must be "controlled" in order to ensure repeatabilty of training. There is a discussion in ONNX "operators" SIG about this subject. See Andreas F.'s [note](https://gist.github.com/Craigacp/883f7e628ce91a370ce4bc3519c9cca0). See also [here](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/6302) and [there](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/issues/6408). Other discussions on theat subject took place in the ONNX Operators SIG's slack channel. Those interested could joint the [SIG's meeting](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/93845487316?password=87cf871b-389e-416b-ae73-60fbe608bc6b).
  - The standard is not very demanding concerning the relation between the model used during training and the MLMD (only "traceability" is required, not "conformity"). Is this really sufficient? If conformity is required, than this ** may ** require additional data to be put in the MLMD. 
- [Comments fromon the ARP6983](../documents/analysis_of_standards/clarification_replication.md)
  - Review of Henri's comments
    - Questions were raised about
      - the "inadequate or incorrect inputs detected during the ML Constituent architecture design process" (about what input are we talking? what does "inadequate" mean?).
    - the comparison of the characteristics of the training and target platform (the platform must be "similar". What does "similar" mean? What is the intent of this requirement?)
  - Jean-Loup's comments: not discussed.
  - Eric to integrate Henri's and Jean-Loup's comments, complete the list of questions, propose a mail to the WG114. The objective is to have a feedback fro them ASAP. See action (0412-3)
- CONV2D operator: Reviews from Jean-Loup and Sebastian have nee taken into account.See the [presentation of the modifications after review](./general/slides/2024-12-04-modifiedconv2Dinformalspec.pdf). A last review is necessary to obtain the "template" that will be used to do the work for the other operators. see action (0412-4).
  - Integrate Jean-Loup proposal to avoid the terms "moved", "shifted": ""the kernel is shifted by 2 units in the first spatial axis and 3 units in the second spatial axis" => "the kernel is applied to data 2 units on right in the first spatial axis and to data 3 units down in the second spatial axis". See action (0412-5)
- Formal methods:
  - A meeting took place about the use of formal methods to describe operators. See the [presentation](./formal_methods/slides-29-11.pdf) that was done at that occasion, and the [incremental minutes](./formal_methods/minutes.md). The main conclusion are that (i) a formal specification is useful, (ii) ACSL could be the most appropriate formalism. 
- Other subjects:
  - Sub-group on Reqs: no new contributors besides Sebastian's and Henri...  
  - Set-up a sub-group to analyse the ONNX standard to continue Nicolas' work which is collected in document [issues](../documents/issues.md). See action (0412-6)

## Minutes
- We are late: deliverable D1.1 was due Oct. 2024, and D1.2 was due Nov. 2024. We have very few needs / reqs, and all from the aero domain. Additional reqs will certainly come from Jean-Baptiste analysis of Aero standards (see action ). Airbus will propose material to complete the list of needs / reqs by the end of this week.
  - [ ] (Jean, Eric) Integrate Airbus' additional nededs / reqs.
- Providing a first list of needs/reqs will certainly clarify what is expected in D1.2...
- In order to accelerate the process, Jean proposes to set up a "core team" composed of representatives of the different industrial domains (or other interested people too). Those people will work specifically on "needs" and "requirements". They will meet in specific meetings... Sebastian and Henri will participate (thanks!). A local physical meeting with people from Airbus, Thales, ADS, TAS, IRT could also be organized in order to speed up the process.  
  - [ ] (Eric) Make a call for participation to the req core team.

## Agenda
- Review of actions
- Feedback on ``conv2d`` operator review (Sebastian)
- Computations accuracy
  - In the last meeting, we have identified that the precision (of computations) of computations are issue. This subject deserves a dedicated meeting and work. All material concerning this topics can be found [here](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/blob/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile/meetings/numerical_issues). A first list of questions and some "food for thought" are available [here](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/blob/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile/meetings/numerical_issues/01_what_is_the_issue.md)
- Other events
  - [ISCLP meeting](https://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga/evenements/ouverture-inscriptions-au-seminaire-futur-lembarque-critique-systemes-combat) at DGA-TA Toulouse
  - Collab. with [DeepGreen](https://deepgreen.ai/) project about reference implementation (followup to [10/25 meeting minutes](safety-related-profile/meetings/Other_meetings/2024-10-25-DeepGreen.md) )

## Participants
JENN Eric, Adrian Evans, Pierre Gaillard, Nicolas Valot , Edoardo Manino, Jean-Loup , Julien VIDALIE, COMBES Yohann, BELCAID Mohammed, Jean-Baptiste Rouffet, Jean Souyris , Cong Liu, Jean-Loup Farges, Claire Pagetti , Thiziri Belkacem Airbus Protect , Dumitru Potop, Sebastian Boblest , Sergei CHICHIN, Boblest Sebastian, Vo Duy Khoi

## Minutes
- Discussion about computation errors (see presentation in [markdown](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/blob/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile/meetings/numerical_issues/slides-06-11.md) and [pdf](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/blob/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile/meetings/numerical_issues/2024-11-06%20-%20Numerical%20issues.pdf))
  - **Slide 10: About weak and strong reproducibility**\
      - Statement is not clear.\
      The idea is that complying with the specification (the MLMD) does not ensure reproducibility: if the specification allows some error with respect to the true value, an implementation may compy with the specification without complying with reproducibility. Therefore, this is another property.  How compliance with the MLMD is ensured is another problem. We may use the "reference implementation" (RI), but it only moves the problem since we will have to demonstrate compliance of the RI to the MLMD... 
      - What does "all implementation" mean?\
        It refers to the set of all *potential* implementations that would comply to the MLMD, not the *actual* set of implementations (which is a subset of the former...). 
      - About the empirical evaluation of the effects of computation errors, see paper "[Causes and effects of unanticipated numerical deviations in neural networks inference frameworks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/af076c3bdbf935b81d808e37c5ede463-Paper-Conference.pdf)"
      - About non-determinism: here, we only care about inference, not training ; we only consider non-determinism due to numerical computations, not other sources such as random number generators...
      - Reproducibility is also a concern for audit activities (or "auditability").
      - [ ] (Eric, Nicolas, Jean-Loup) Finish the discussion about "reproducibility"...
      - [ ] (Eric) Integrate paper in [document](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/blob/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile/meetings/numerical_issues/01_what_is_the_issue.md). 
  - **Slide 12: importance of accuracy for ML**
      The effects of mathematical error may strongly depend on the type of application (e.g., regression *vs.* classification) 
  - **Slide 15: mathematical libraries**
    - There are version of ``libm`` that give explicitly accuracy requirements. See e.g., [sleef](https://github.com/shibatch/sleef/tree/master/docs/2-references/libm)
  - **Slide 17**
    - Over/under flow can be easily avoided using "accumulator" with a sufficient size. <off meeting: but overflow may occur in other situations>
    - **General** 
      - The slide are focus on the second part of the W cycle. Howver, as the MLMD is at he transition  between the two Vs, we also have to consider the relation between the ML model used during training and evaluation and the MLMD. In particular, what needs to be put in the MLMD to support the activities occuring in the ascending part of the first V (in order to ensure that the MLML delivered to the developper is correct)? 
      - In fact, what is (could be considered as) the actual reference is the model used for the training and evaluation that is executed using e.g., TensorFlow. Therefore, we shall provide all embed all the necessary information (metadata) in the MLMD to precisely designate this environment (framework, version of framework, machine, operating system,etc.). Note that the current version of ONNX aleady has this capability. <off meeting: another approach would be to consider that the evaluation of the model should be done using the reference implementation. This would really make the SONNX model THE specification.../>
  - [ ] (0611-2 - Eric) Prepare a followup to the discussion about computation errors: what is the impact on the MLMD?
  
- Review of Sebastian's remarks on the ``conv2d`` operator specification
  - Detailled remarks are in [Sebastian's branch](https://github.com/SebastianBoblest/working-groups/tree/lookAtConvSpec/safety-related-profile/documents/conv_specification_example). 
  - Major remarks:
    - Some restrictions (of the current version) prevent the description of some of the use models. For instance, the ``group`` attribute must support depthwise convolution with channel multiplier 1.
    - Many attributes of the ONNX spec are optional or "redundant" in the sense that their role can be played using other, more primitive attribnutes. For instance, the ``auto_pad`` attribute can be replaced by an explicit choice of padding. 
    - The SONNX profile shall provide a single solution without restricting capabilities ("There shall be a unique way to do things").
    - It also makes life of "customers" (aka "users") simpler.
    - The presentation is OK. The diagram must be kept, but corrected (see detailled comments)
    - [ ] (Jean-Loup) Review the conv2d operator
    - [ ] (Eric, Mariem) Update conv2d spec according to Sebastian's and Jean-Loup's reviews

## Participants
(Was not able to retrieve the list from TEAMS)
## Minutes
- See agenda
  
### About the “Steering Committee”
- EMB will not be able to participate to our periodic meetings (every two weeks) but is nevertheless willing to contribute to our effort via a *Streeing Committe* (SC). The objective of the SC is to monitor important (”key”) moments in the progression of activities (“gates” , “phase transitions”, etc.).
- The SC shall be planned in advance. Basically: one SC every SC will be fine.
- [ ] (A008 - leads) Plan SC meetings

### About the templates
3 “template” document were presented (see link above)
- “Issues template”
    - Dumitru proposes to add a description / illustration of the effects of an issue. ⇒ to be added in the template
    - Concerning issue #2 (order of operations)
        - Dumitru (following a remark already done by Sebastian, a long time ago…)  emphasizes that there is not problem of non determinism / interpretation on the order of processing of operator: if one follows the topological ordering,  result of floating point computations are completely and unambiguoulsy determined. There may still be issues with random numbers.
        - [ ]  (A009 - Dumitru) Correct  / complete description of issue #2
- Use case / scope template
    - Nicolas : a description can simply refer to an existing model in the Hugging Face repository using a hypertext link.
    - Nicolas proposes a script to extract the list of operators. (To be placed in the “tools” area)...
    - [ ] (A010 - leads) Create a “tools” area
    - [ ] (A011 - Nicolas) Deposit his operator extraction tool in the repository
    - [ ] (A012 - Nicolas) Review the the "issues" document
  
### About sub-groups

- Floating point computation
    - [ ]  (A013 - leads) Organize a meeting on numerical computations (fp-sg)
    - [ ]  (A014 - fp-sg) Provide a clear statement of the numerical computations issues.

- Formal methods
    - The PoC must be completed, incl. aspect about formal methods
    - The value of a formal specification must be estimated (value in terms of communication, automation,…)
    - A formal language must be selected.
    - This is to be covered by the fm-sg, see action A005

Other (off-meeting) 
- [ ]  (Nicolas) See if we can involve the authors of the paper on ONNX conversion in order to identify Exploiter le papier / probblème

## Minutes
- Discussion about the github structure and management.
    - Question was raised about the nature of the document we could put on the github:
      - The principle is that ANY document put on our repo is publicly accessible. So, **no document with restiction** shall be placed in the repo.
      - Concerning the possible publications of the workgroup, we will use a private Overleaf (e.g.) account to work in common. 
    - Mariem has reminded us the (usual) way to use github. See her [slides](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/blob/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile/documents/procedures/ModifGithubONNX.pdf)
    - This approach seems a bit complicated, especially if we are working in common on documents.It is necessary because the project is public and so requires some control before accepting modifications. Using a private project could be simpler. 
    - [X] (05/09) Henri to propose document edition / sharing modalities
      - See [proposal](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/blob/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile/documents/procedures/collaborative_docs.md)
    - Currently, we are working on Eric's branch that is hosted in a private account (github.com/ericjenn/...). It may be cleaner to use a specific account for our workgroup (e.g., github.com/sonnx./...)

## Actions
  - [ ] (09/09) Eric to check if we could create a SONNX account in github
  - [ ] (05/09) Eric to check with Ram if there is any "rule"/ "contraint" imposed by ONNX on the use of github 
  - [X] (05/09) Henri to propose document edition / sharing modalities
    - See [proposal]()
  - [ ]  <21/08> (Mariem, eric, Loïc) Propose an first axiomatization of tensors (3D, 4D) and use it to specify the CONV operator.
  - [ ]  <21/08> (Mariem, Loïc, Eric, Augustin) Specify the CONV operator for int8 and (e.g., ) float16….
  - [ ]  <21/08> (Eric+Jean) In the SoW, avoid the use of the term “ambiguity”. Be more explicit about the different types of requirements. Introduce the concept of "replication" 
  - [ ]  <10/07>(eric+jean) Organize some meetings as “advisory boards”

# SONNX meeting (21/08)

## Object

- ONNX Safety-related workgroup meeting

## Attendees

- Mariem, Nicolas, Augustin, Eric

## Minutes

- Status of actions (see below)
- Brief recap of the work done on the CONV operator (Mariem)
    - The Why3 specification is now complete thanks to Loïc. A FrameC implementation is also available.
        
        
        - [ ]  <21/08> (Mariem) Convert the CONV operator specification to markdown.
    - After discussion with Loïc, the appropriate solution would be first to “axiomatize” tensors (in the same way it has already been done for matrices).
        
        
        - [ ]  <21/08> (Mariem, eric, Loïc) Propose an first axiomatization of tensors (3D, 4D) and use it to specify the CONV operator.
- Discussion of Nicolas’ comments on the SOW
    - Four points were discussed
        - We have introduced new terms (”TMD, TMDL) that are neither used in the ONNX community (where the term “ONNX IR” is used) nor in the ARP (where the term “MLMD” is used). We have either to stick to one of those — possibly ONNX’ — or at least explain the correspondence between them…
        - Nicolas mentioned that we have to “address the semantic of the model storage (ONNX IR for safety critical) […]”.
            - Yes, this should be covered by the activities concerning the semantics and the syntax of the model description language. Nicolas also raised the question about discriminating the model used during the design and the model used as the starting point of the implementation. *But it is not clear whether we really need to discriminate them: we are only concerned by the semantics of the model, whatever its used.* However, we will not consider operators used during training, so our profile will only be applicable during inference…
        - Nicolas what not happy with the remark about “ambiguous” models  (sentence  “[…] ambiguous if this ambiguity is acceptable or even necessary to leave some freedom to the implementer […]): *I do not see any reason for that. The model shall be unambiguous. If the implementer chooses to implement a surrogate model (optimized), then this model is the MLMD to be specified using ONNX. ARP6983 specifies that replication criteria shall be specified*.
            - This is an important point. The model shall actually be non ambiguous. The user may introduce derived requirements about implementation (e.g., the order in which operators have to be executed). This contingency is what was meant by the term “ambiguity”. We have to be more explicit in the SoW: the specification will not be ambiguous, but there will be some “flexibility” about the set of derived requirements applicable to a given model.
            
            - [ ]  <21/08> (Eric+Jeans) In the SoW, avoid the use of the term “ambiguity”. Be more explicit about the different types of requirements. Introduce the concept of “replication criteria” and clarify its relation to requirements.
        - Nicolas mentioned that “All the activities consist in paper work. Is there some room for POC for formal verification, extension of the definition of the format, tools to build, review, verify a SONNX MLMD ? Who are the users/recipients of the outputs ? (I would guess that some output are for us, some others for ONNX community...).”
            - Only the first part of the remark was discussed: we actually need some “practical” work in order to validate our proposal. We should introduce a “running example” (e.g., MobileNet) that will be specified using SONNX, implemented, compared with a reference implementation, etc.  Those “practical” implementation activities have to be described in the SoW too.
                
                
                - [ ]  <21/08> (Eric+Jeans) Add to the SoW activities related to the validation of the WG results through its application to a practical use case
- Discussion about polymorphic operators: *we have to provide a specific specification for every types supported by an operator,* i.e., there will be a specification of the CONV operator for int8, float16, etc. This is in particular necessary for ints for which saturation is necessary. We should do the exercise on the CONV operator.
    
    
    - [ ]  <21/08> (Mariem, Loïc, Eric, Augustin) Specify the CONV operator for int8 and (e.g., ) float16….
- We have to specify the broadcasting rules (see [https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Broadcasting.md](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Broadcasting.md)).
- Logistics
    - All documents should be in the same place. At the moment, some documents are on the IRT’s sharepoint while some other at in the ONNX github. Office documents where placed in the Sharepoint for they were directly editable by some users. For other (e.g., Airbus), Sharepoint documents need to be downloaded first, which make Sharepoint pointless. 
    - [X]  <21/08> (Eric) Convert the SOW to markdown, move all documents to github
        - Documents have moved [here](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/tree/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile/documents).
    - The Sharepoint has moved in order to match the new project name, which is “SONNX”. The URL is now : [https://extranet.irt-saintexupery.com/Extranet/Projets/SONNX/Pages/default.aspx](https://extranet.irt-saintexupery.com/Extranet/Projets/SONNX/Pages/default.aspx)
    - The github repository is accessible at  [https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/tree/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/tree/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile).
    
    - [ ]  <21/08> (eric+Jean) Clarifies the use of github…
