## Agenda
- Presentation of "templates" to start of activies on
    - definition of [use cases, models, operators](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/blob/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile/documents/usecases.md)
    - elicitation of [needs](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/blob/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile/documents/needs.md)
    - identificaiton of [issues ](https://github.com/ericjenn/working-groups/blob/ericjenn-srpwg-wg1/safety-related-profile/documents/issues.md)
- Discussion about the creation of a sub-group (who?)
    - on formal methods
    - on numerical issues (?)
- Status of integration with ONNX community
    - Brief presentation of the Linux Fundation support to our activities (=> Andreas, Friday, report during next meeting)
    - 
## Participants
(Was not able to retrieve the list from TEAMS)
## Minutes
### About the “Steering Committee”
- EMB will not be able to participate to our periodic meetings (every two weeks) but is nevertheless willing to contribute to our effort via a *Streeing Committe* (SC). The objective of the SC is to monitor important (”key”) moments in the progression of activities (“gates” , “phase transitions”, etc.).
- The SC shall be planned in advance. Basically: one SC every SC will be fine.
- [ ]  (eric) Plan meetings of the SC

### About the templates
3 “template” document were presented (see link above)
- “Issues template”
    - Dumitru proposes to add a description / illustration of the effects of an issue. ⇒ to be added in the template
    - Concerning issue #2 (order of operations)
        - Dumitru (following a remark already done by Sebastian, a long time ago…)  emphasizes that there is not problem of non determinism / interpretation on the order of processing of operator: if one follows the topological ordering,  result of floating point computations are completely and unambiguoulsy determined. There may still be issues with random numbers.
        - [ ]  (Dumitru) Correct  / complete description of issue #2
- Use case / scope template
    - Nicolas : a description can simply refer to an existing model in the Hugging Face repository using a hypertext link.
    - Nicolas proposes a script to extract the list of operators. (To be placed in the “tools” area)...
    - [ ] (Eric) Create a “tools” area
    - [ ] (Nicolas) Deposit his operator extraction tool in the repository.
    - [ ] (Nicolas) Review the the "issues" document
  
### About sub-groups

- Floating point computation
    - [ ]  (Eric) Organize a meeting on numerical computations (fp-sg)
    - [ ]  (fp-sg) Provide a clear statement of the issue with numerical computations.

- Formal methods
    - The PoC must be completed, incl. aspect about formal methods
    - The value of a formal specification must be estimated (value in terms of communication, automation,…)
    - A formal language must be selected.
    - This is to be covered by the fm-sg, see action A005

Other (off-meeting) 
- [ ]  (Nicolas) See if we can involve the authors of the paper on ONNX conversion in order to identify Exploiter le papier / probblème
