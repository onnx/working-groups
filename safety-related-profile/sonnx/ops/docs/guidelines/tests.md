SONNX provides a set of tests developed using the [Hypothesis framework](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

- verification of a specific implementation with respect to the "reference implementation" developed in SONNX. 

Note that they are **functional tests** aimed at covering the function realized by operators, with no consideration about their actual implementation. 

Those tests may reused as part of users' verification activities, but the SONNX working group does not
