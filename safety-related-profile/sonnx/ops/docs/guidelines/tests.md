# Purpose

SONNX provides a set of tests developed using the [Hypothesis framework](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  

Those functional tests are used for two main purposes:
- verification of the consistency between the SONNX specification and existing implementations of the ONNX standard (e.g., ONNX Runtime)
- verification of a specific implementation with respect to the "reference implementation" developed in SONNX. 

# Disclaimer
The test developed by SONNX are **functional tests** aimed at covering the function realized by operators, with no consideration about their actual implementation. 

Those tests may reused as part of users' verification activities, but with no guarantee of completeness. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that his/her test set complies with his/her test objectives.
