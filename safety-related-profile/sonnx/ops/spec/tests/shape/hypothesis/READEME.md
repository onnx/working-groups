# How to run
There are two main scripts, test_shape.py and check_edges.py

Before run any of those scripts you need to have the requirements that are presented at requirements.txt

To run the test_shape.py you need to do
```bash
pytest test_shape.py
```
Or if you want to see more information about the tests
```bash
pytest -s test_shape.py
```
This script will generate a json file with all the tests that were generated.

To run check_edges.py you need to do
```bash
python check_edges.py
```
Make sure that you have the json file generated by test_shape.py

# Explanations of Shape corner and edge cases generation

## Assumptions
First of all let us explain what we mean by corner and edge cases.
- **Corner cases** are the extreme values of a given parameter, such as the minimum and maximum values that the parameter can take.

- **Edge cases** are values that are just above or below the minimum and maximum values, respectively.

## Shape tests
For the shape operator we just **checked both the corner and edge cases** for the **rank_input_tensor**, **shape_input_tensor**, **x_type**, **start** and **end**.

We consider **rank_input_tensor**, **shape_input_tensor**, **x_type**, **start** and **end** as **lines** since they are independent and we checked the corner and edge cases for both of them.
