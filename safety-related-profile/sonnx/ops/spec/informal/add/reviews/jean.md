* ONNX bfloat16 type is in the ONNX description of add but not in SONNX add.md. If this type is never used in SONNX, it has to be inserted as a general restriction.

* INT4 and UINT4 are in SONNX add.md but not in the ONNX description of add.

* Add reference to the ONNX documentation. Taken into account in add.md.

Rmk3: broken links. Already fixed.

Rmk4: Replace the type names by their counterpart in ONNX. Example: replace "FP64" by "double". Taken into account in add.md.
