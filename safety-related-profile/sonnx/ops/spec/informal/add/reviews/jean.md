Rmk1: Typos and reformatting, already taken into account in add.md

Rmk2: Contents section. 

* ONNX bfloat16 type is in the ONNX description of add but not in SONNX add.md. If this type is never used in SONNX, it has to be inserted as a general restriction.

* INT4 and UINT4 are in SONNX add.md but not in the ONNX description of add.

Rmk3: broken links. Already fixed.
